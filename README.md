# Apparels-Recommendation-System
Personalized product recommendations are the alternative way of navigating through the online shop. More people find products they need. Even if they didnâ€™t think of them. We have tried to build a recommendation engine which suggests similar products to the given product in any e-commerce websites e.g. Amazon.com, myntra.com etc. The recommendation engine, uses information of about 180k products and each product will have multiple features named title, brand, colour, type, image, etc. For making our recommendation time efficient we have boiled down our data set to 16k.But as of now we have used only product title as the basis of our recommendation. In this process we have converted our title into numerical vector using a vectorization technique called as TF-IDF vectorization. After this we have calculated the Euclidean distance between the searched title and the available titles to find the five most related product as per the searched title.
